Code written by Xuan Sun at Caltech.

This repo is intended to simulate and characterize the noise in the SQUID detectors.

dataset.cc generates a Monte Carlo dataset.

dataset.cc generates the dataset and the code has a fitting function inside it.
histfitter.cc is supposed to fit the data generated by dataset.
But I'm losing track of which output files are what so it's temporarily on hold.

dataset.cc was renamed to lightoutput_dataset.cc.
The function sampled in lightoutput_dataset.cc corresponds to the light read by SiPMTs
for the He3 and neutron beat frequency alignment.
A new code, squid_dataset.cc, will generate a signal with a noise appropriate for the SQUIDs.

The goal is to use the frequency (or frequencies) identified in squid_dataset.cc 
as the frequency used in the seed or to fit with for lightoutput_dataset.cc.
